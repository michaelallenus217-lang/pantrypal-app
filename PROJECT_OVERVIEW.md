- [ ] Portfolio website showcasing project

---

## 🔥 Momentum Strategy

**Weekly Commits:** Commit something every week, even if small
- Builds GitHub contribution graph
- Shows consistency to recruiters
- Maintains momentum

**Monthly Milestones:** Hit at least 80% of each month's goals
- Acceptable to be 2-3 weeks behind
- Focus on completion over perfection

**Public Progress:** Tweet/post about progress monthly
- "Month 2: Backend API 80% complete with 15 endpoints"
- "Month 4: Mobile app can scan barcodes and track inventory"
- Shows progression, builds accountability

---

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

**Ghost Bistro Construction (Jun-Sep 2026):**
- Front-load work in Months 1-5
- Schedule only maintenance during peak chaos
- Pre-deploy apps in May if needed

**Family Time Constraints:**
- Build during nap times and evenings
- Some weeks will be 8 hours instead of 15
- Wife feedback as alpha testing = family involvement

**Scope Creep:**
- Stick to MVP features through Month 8
- No new features until apps are in stores
- Polish is better than partial features

**Learning Curve:**
- 20% time buffer for troubleshooting
- Use Udemy/docs proactively
- Ask for help when stuck >2 hours

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Actions

**Right Now:**
1. Read WEEKEND_CHECKLIST.md fully
2. Make sure you have 2-3 hours available this weekend
3. Clear Downloads folder (you'll need it)

**Saturday Morning:**
1. Download all 14 files from this chat
2. Verify you have all files in Downloads
3. Start WEEKEND_CHECKLIST.md Task 1

**Sunday Evening Goal:**
- GitHub repository live and pinned
- All documentation committed
- Backend structure created
- Ready to code next weekend

---

## 📞 When You're Stuck

**Common Issues:**
- GitHub authentication → Use Personal Access Token
- Git commands failing → Check you're in right directory (pwd)
- Files not uploading → Verify git add/commit/push sequence
- Can't find files → Check Downloads folder

**Decision Framework:**
1. Stuck <30 min → Google the error
2. Stuck 30-60 min → Check GitHub Issues on similar projects
3. Stuck >60 min → Ask for help (message me)

---

## 💪 Motivation

**Why This Matters:**

You're not just building an app. You're building:
- **Proof** you can ship software
- **Evidence** of full-stack capability  
- **Demonstration** of project management
- **Example** of technical communication
- **Signal** to IBM: you're ready for data engineering

**Most people** talk about building projects.  
**You** will have a live, deployed app in 12 months.

**That difference gets you interviews.**
